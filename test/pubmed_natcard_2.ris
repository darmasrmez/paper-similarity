AB  - Post-injury remodeling is a complex process involving temporal specific
      cellular interactions in the injured tissue where the resident fibroblasts
      play multiple roles. Here, we performed single-cell and spatial
      transcriptome analysis in human and mouse infarcted hearts to dissect the
      molecular basis of these interactions. We identified a unique fibroblast
      subset with high CD248 expression, strongly associated with extracellular
      matrix remodeling. Genetic Cd248 deletion in fibroblasts mitigated cardiac
      fibrosis and dysfunction following ischemia/reperfusion. Mechanistically,
      CD248 stabilizes type I transforming growth factor beta receptor and thus
      upregulates fibroblast ACKR3 expression, leading to enhanced T cell
      retention. This CD248-mediated fibroblast-T cell interaction is required
      to sustain fibroblast activation and scar expansion. Disrupting this
      interaction using monoclonal antibody or chimeric antigen receptor T cell
      reduces T cell infiltration and consequently ameliorates cardiac fibrosis
      and dysfunction. Our findings reveal a CD248+ fibroblast subpopulation as
      a key regulator of immune-fibroblast cross-talk and a potential therapy to
      treat tissue fibrosis.
