AB  - Underwater object detection is critical for oceanic research and
      industrial safety inspections. However, the complex optical environment
      and the limited resources of underwater equipment pose significant
      challenges to achieving high accuracy and low power consumption. To
      address these issues, we propose Spiking Underwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a
      Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the lightweight and
      energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a novel
      spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer
      addition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal
      computational overhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch
      Normalization (SeBN), a technique that normalizes feature maps
      independently across multiple time steps and is optimized for integration
      with residual structures to capture the temporal dynamics of SNNs more
      effectively. The redesigned spiking residual blocks integrate the Cross
      Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO architecture to mitigate
      spike degradation and enhance the modelâ€™s feature extraction capabilities.
      Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset demonstrate that
      SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an energy
      consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both detection
      accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the
      potential of SNNs for engineering applications. The code is available in
