AB  - We propose a novel approach for generating complex outputs that
      significantly improves accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks. Our method leverages
      execution results to select the most semantically consistent query from
      multiple candidates, enabling smaller, cost-effective models to surpass
      computationally intensive reasoning methods such as o1, o3-mini, and
      DeepSeek R1 while reducing inference cost by as much as 30 times. It
      integrates effortlessly with existing models, offering a practical and
      scalable pathway to state-of-the-art SQL generation.
