AB  - Lung and gastrointestinal diseases often occur together, leading to more
      adverse health outcomes than when a disease of one of these systems occurs
      alone. However, the potential genetic mechanisms underlying
      lung-gastrointestinal comorbidities remain unclear. Here, we leverage lung
      and gastrointestinal trait data from individuals of European, East Asian
      and African ancestries, to perform a large-scale genetic cross trait
      analysis, followed by functional annotation and Mendelian randomization
      analysis to explore the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of
      lung-gastrointestinal comorbidities. Notably, we find significant genetic
      correlations between 27 trait pairs among the European population. The
      highest correlation is between chronic bronchitis and peptic ulcer
      disease. At the variant level, we identify 42 candidate pleiotropic
      genetic variants (3 of them previously uncharacterized) in 14 trait pairs
      by integrating cross-trait meta-analysis, fine-mapping and colocalization
      analyses. We also find 66 candidate pleiotropic genes, most of which were
      enriched in immune or inflammatory response-related activities. Causal
      inference approaches result in 4 potential lung-gastrointestinal
      associations. Introducing the gut microbiota as a variable establishes a
      relationship between the genus Parasutterella, gastro-oesophageal reflux
      disease and asthma. In summary, our findings highlight the genetic
      relationship between lung and gastrointestinal diseases, providing
      insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of lung
      gastrointestinal comorbidities.
